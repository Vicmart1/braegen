          <div class="title">Background</div>
          Glioblastoma Multiforme, or GBM, is the most common and deadly primary brain cancer. 1 in 5 of all brain tumors are GBM, and over 18,000 new patients in the US are diagnosed with GBM every year, including loved ones and familiar faces like John McCain. The median overall survival for a GBM patient is just over 14 months.<br/><br/><br/>
          <!--div id="hexagon-graphs"></div-->
          In other words, diagnosis is essentially a <b>death</b> sentence.<br/><br/><br/>
          So what treatment options are there?<br/><br/><br/>
          The Stupp Protocol is the standard-of-care treatment of surgery followed by adjuct radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, GBM's unique characteristics negates the effects of treatment. The infiltrative growth of GBM makes total surgical resection impossible and radiation therapy difficult without damaging healthy tissue. But perhaps the largest rate limiting obstacle for treating primary brain tumors in patients is the blood-brain barrier. The BBB prevents 99.9% of drugs from reaching tumor sites, rendering oral or intravenous chemotherapy ineffective. And past <b>six months</b>, there is no standard-of-care.<br/><br/><br/>
          <b>Zero.</b><br/><br/><br/>
          <b>Zero</b> effective treatment for treating one of the most deadly brain cancers.<br/><br/><br/>
          In order to change that, we realized we need to disrupt the industry with something revolutionary.<br/><br/><br/>
          And we have the solution - an implantable device that enables direct drug delivery. Being direct bypasses the blood brain barrier, and being long-term fights against recurrence over time. With all this tech, we're still not compromising other key criteria for GBM treatment.<br/><br/><br/>

          Because our goal isn't just to innovate cancer treatment, it's to disrupt.

          Braegen was born when five undergraduate biomedical engineering students decided they could advance the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme through implatable technology. Since then, the team has grown dramatically, both in terms of students and partners. To date, Braegen has eight core team members from diverse backgrounds such as computer science, medicinal history, and business development.

            Zhou is the most well-balanced team member. Equally an product developer, tester, public speaker, and author, she is ready to help whenever needed. And because of that, the team could not function without her. Additionally, she co-wrote an academic paper with Victor, and is secretly a singer/songwriter in her freetime.

          <div class="title">Our Sponsors</div>
          In addition to a stellar team of students, Braegen is backed by several innovative and influential figures from the world's leading hospital. On the left is Dr. Chad Gordon, director of Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the Multidisciplinary Adult Cranioplasty Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine. In fact, Dr. Gordon first came to Victor with the idea of a portable platform for direct drug delivery, along with Dr. Jon Weingart (pictured center). Dr. Weingart is a Professor of Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, and has worked closely with Dr. Gordon for over a decade, identifying the very real clinical need of Braegen's breakthrough product.<br/><br/>
          Finally on the right is Dr. Amir Manbachi of JHU's Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design. Dr. Manbachi is a veteran of Neurosurgery, and his insightful and thoughtful mentorship has propelled the team throughout the year. Without these three key leaders, Braegen could not be where it is now.<br/><br/><br/>
