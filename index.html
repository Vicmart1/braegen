          <div class="paragraph">Brain tumors represent an incredibly deadly type of cancer, with over 75,000 new cases per year. Paired with quickly worsening symptoms and shockingly limited treatment options, prognosis is often grim for recently diagnosed patients.</div>
          <br/><br/>
          <div class="paragraph">Take Glioblastoma Multiforme, or GBM, for example - it is the most common and deadly primary brain cancer. 1 in 5 of all brain tumors are GBM, and over 18,000 new patients in the US are diagnosed with GBM every year - often times loved ones and familiar faces. The median overall survival for a GBM patient is just over 14 months.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">So what treatment options are there?</div>
          <br/><br/>
          <div class="paragraph">The Stupp Protocol is the standard-of-care treatment of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, GBM's unique characteristics negates the effects of treatment. The infiltrative growth of GBM makes total surgical resection impossible and radiation therapy difficult without damaging healthy tissue. But perhaps the largest rate limiting obstacle for treating primary brain tumors in patients is the blood-brain barrier. The BBB prevents 99.9% of drugs from reaching tumor sites, rendering oral or intravenous chemotherapy ineffective.

And we have the solution - an patent-pending implantable device that enables direct drug delivery. Being direct bypasses the blood brain barrier, and being long-term fights against recurrence over time.</div>

          <div class="paragraph">Braegen was born when five undergraduate biomedical engineering students decided they could advance the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme through implatable technology. Since then, the team has grown dramatically, both in terms of students and partners. To date, Braegen has eight core team members from diverse backgrounds such as computer science, medicinal history, and business development.</div>

Dr. Chad Gordon is the director of Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the Multidisciplinary Adult Cranioplasty Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine. In fact, Dr. Gordon first came to Victor with the idea of a portable platform for direct drug delivery, along with Dr. Jon Weingart. Dr. Weingart is a Professor of Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, and has worked closely with Dr. Gordon for over a decade, identifying the very real clinical need of Braegen's breakthrough product.</div>
